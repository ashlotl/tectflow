# tectflow
A procedural world generator for exoplanets with a tectonic plate simulation.
Tectflow is written entirely in Rust and uses Vulkan (the binding code for this is, unfortunately, `unsafe`) with an aim of offloading significant work to the GPU.

Project Goals:
Asteroids
Tectonic Plate Simulations
Glaciers 
Volcanoes + Islands
